# Development Status

## Resume here

- Stage: `0.1.0-alpha.1`; Gate B and the full Gate C implementation are
  complete locally.
- Integration branch: `main` at `f0298a9`. The maintainer pushed the validate
  integration, verified hosted Linux, macOS, and Windows CI, and removed the
  remote validate topic branch.
- Current branch: `codex/feat-gate-c-init-scan`. It contains D012, versioned
  init/scan models, self-contained template init, deterministic structural
  scan, the final 19 executable contract cases, and this documentation
  closeout. Maintainer push, hosted CI, and integration remain the final Gate C
  checkpoint.
- D012 embeds the seven repository-owned templates without ambient discovery
  and fixes scan's infrastructure ignore set, naming precedence, ordering,
  recurrence limit, coverage rounding, and no-inference boundary.
- `norm-core` now owns parse, collect, schema/profile/semantic validation, init
  and scan response contracts, plus deterministic scan aggregation. `norm-cli`
  owns arguments, embedded assets, filesystem orchestration, presentation, and
  exits.
- All 4 global, 13 parse, 11 collect, 35 validate, 9 init, and 10 scan cases
  execute the compiled binary in isolated roots with no skips: 82 of 82 frozen
  cases.
- All five production commands are functional. Gate D consumer-resolvable
  contracts/conformance and Gate E distribution/release readiness remain open;
  Gate C completion does not claim those later gates.
- The private GitHub repository and hosted Actions are established and green
  through integrated validate. Public visibility remains a maintainer
  checkpoint.

## Verification

Full Gate C local verification on 2026-08-11:

- `cargo fmt --check` → green.
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` →
  green.
- `cargo test --workspace --all-features` → 48 Rust test functions passed. The
  static 91-requirement / 82-case inventory gate and all 82 compiled-binary
  cases passed with asserted streams, protocols, output data, and exits.
- All seven embedded templates parse as A1, validate strictly against their
  profile schemas, and the init integration test proves byte-for-byte output.
- `cargo run -p norm-spec-cli -- validate --all --strict --json` → five files,
  zero errors, zero warnings.
- `cargo run -p norm-spec-cli -- scan --root . --text` → 27 directories, five
  `.norm` files, no symlinks, and `0.185` coverage; infrastructure directories
  were excluded.
- `RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --workspace --no-deps` → green.
- `bash scripts/check-public-history.sh` → green across the current index and
  all reachable commits.
- `cargo install --path crates/norm-cli --root <isolated> --locked` → green;
  the installed binary initialized a module template, strictly validated it,
  and scanned its isolated root with full coverage.
- Hosted Linux, macOS, and Windows evidence for the final init/scan branch is
  pending maintainer push.

## Open-source readiness

- [x] Independent public `0.1` history and product identity.
- [x] Security policy, code of conduct, and structured issue/PR templates.
- [x] High-confidence secret, sensitive filename, and private-path history scan.
- [x] GitHub Actions references pinned to full commit SHAs.
- [x] Private GitHub repository creation, initial `main` push, and hosted
      Actions.
- [x] Node 24 Action pins verified green on GitHub without annotations.
- [ ] Configure `main` protection when repository visibility or the
      organization plan permits it.

## Open work

- [x] Freeze the five-command behavior contract (parse, collect, validate,
      init, scan) in one pass.
- [x] Establish all six protocol identifiers and a statically checked manifest
      with complete requirement, flag, success/error, and asset coverage.
- [x] Decide symbolic-link containment, rejection, and reporting semantics
      before collect, validate, and scan implementation (D007).
- [x] Select and spike the YAML parser dependency (D009).
- [x] Select and spike the Draft 7 validator dependency (D010).
- [x] Implement A1/legacy parse and all executable global/parse cases.
- [x] Implement deterministic path-scoped collect and all executable collect
      cases.
- [x] Implement schema, profile, and semantic validation plus all executable
      validate cases.
- [x] Implement self-contained init and deterministic structural scan plus all
      executable init/scan cases.
- [ ] Provide consumer-resolvable Rust/machine contracts and a conformance
      entry point without sibling-path coupling (Gate D).
- [ ] Complete cross-platform distribution and release-readiness review
      (Gate E).
